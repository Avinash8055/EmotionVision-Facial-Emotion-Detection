Facial Emotion Recognition System 

Designed and implemented a state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based system for nuanced interpretation of emotional expressions in facial imagery.
Collected and processed 2,000 sample data for each emotion, leveraging TensorFlow and Keras to develop a robust model architecture.
Optimized the model for real-time performance, achieving enhanced accuracy through strategic data augmentation and advanced deep learning techniques.
Integrated OpenCV for efficient image processing and real-time implementation, enabling the system to read and interpret facial expressions from live camera feed, displaying the detected emotion on-screen.
